    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to use a builder API when constructing Neural Networks in TensorFlow because it makes it easier to implement and modify the source-code. This also lowers the risk of bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the other tutorials used the TensorFlow builder API called PrettyTensor for easy construction of Neural Networks. But there are several other builder APIs available for TensorFlow. PrettyTensor was used in these tutorials, because at the time in mid-2016, PrettyTensor was the most complete and polished builder API available for TensorFlow. But PrettyTensor is only developed by a single person working at Google and although it has some unique and elegant features, it is possible that it may become deprecated in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is about a small builder API that has recently been added to TensorFlow version 1.1. It is simply called *Layers* or the *Layers API* or by its Python name `tf.layers`. This builder API is automatically installed as part of TensorFlow, so you no longer have to install a separate Python package as was needed with PrettyTensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is very similar to Tutorial #03 on PrettyTensor and shows how to implement the same Convolutional Neural Network using the Layers API. It is recommended that you are familiar with Tutorial #02 on Convolutional Neural Networks."

    "The input image is processed in the first convolutional layer using the filter-weights. This results in 16 new images, one for each filter in the convolutional layer. The images are also down-sampled using max-pooling so the image resolution is decreased from 28x28 to 14x14.\n",
    "\n",
    "These 16 smaller images are then processed in the second convolutional layer. We need filter-weights for each of these 16 channels, and we need filter-weights for each output channel of this layer. There are 36 output channels so there are a total of 16 x 36 = 576 filters in the second convolutional layer. The resulting images are also down-sampled using max-pooling to 7x7 pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the second convolutional layer is 36 images of 7x7 pixels each. These are then flattened to a single vector of length 7 x 7 x 36 = 1764, which is used as the input to a fully-connected layer with 128 neurons (or elements). This feeds into another fully-connected layer with 10 neurons, one for each of the classes, which is used to determine the class of the image, that is, which number is depicted in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "The convolutional filters are initially chosen at random, so the classification is done randomly. The error between the predicted and true class of the input image is measured as the so-called cross-entropy. The optimizer then automatically propagates this error back through the Convolutional Network using the chain-rule of differentiation and updates the filter-weights so as to improve the classification error. This is done iteratively thousands of times until the classification error is sufficiently low.\n",
    "\n",
    "These particular filter-weights and intermediate images are the results of one optimization run and may look different if you re-run this Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the computation in TensorFlow is actually done on a batch of images instead of a single image, which makes the computation more efficient. This means the flowchart actually has one more data-dimension when implemented in TensorFlow."

    "## TensorFlow Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "The entire purpose of TensorFlow is to have a so-called computational graph that can be executed much more efficiently than if the same calculations were to be performed directly in Python. TensorFlow can be more efficient than NumPy because TensorFlow knows the entire computation graph that must be executed, while NumPy only knows the computation of a single mathematical operation at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow can also automatically calculate the gradients that are needed to optimize the variables of the graph so as to make the model perform better. This is because the graph is a combination of simple mathematical expressions so the gradient of the entire graph can be calculated using the chain-rule for derivatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow can also take advantage of multi-core CPUs as well as GPUs - and Google has even built special chips just for TensorFlow which are called TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) and are even faster than GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A TensorFlow graph consists of the following parts which will be detailed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Placeholder variables used for inputting data to the graph.\n",
    "* Variables that are going to be optimized so as to make the convolutional network perform better.\n",
    "* The mathematical formulas for the convolutional neural network.\n",
    "* A so-called cost-measure or loss-function that can be used to guide the optimization of the variables.\n",
    "* An optimization method which updates the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the TensorFlow graph may also contain various debugging statements e.g. for logging data to be displayed using TensorBoard, which is not covered in this tutorial."

    "\n",
    "This tutorial showed how to use the so-called *Layers API* for easily building Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow. The syntax is different and more verbose than that of PrettyTensor. Both builder API's have advantages and disadvantages, but since PrettyTensor is only developed by one person and the Layers API is now an official part of TensorFlow Core, it is possible that PrettyTensor will become deprecated in the future. If this happens, we might hope that some of its unique and elegant features will become integrated into TensorFlow Core as well.\n",

    "* Replace the 2x2 max-pooling layers with stride=2 in the convolutional layers. Is there a difference in classification accuracy? What if you optimize it again and again? The difference is random, so how would you measure if there really is a difference? What are the pros and cons of using max-pooling vs. stride in the conv-layer?\n",
    "* Change the parameters for the layers, e.g. the kernel, depth, size, etc. What is the difference in time usage and classification accuracy?\n",
