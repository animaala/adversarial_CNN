## This tutorial shows an alternative way to the `shapesorter` example of how to add your directory of `jpeg` images to a TFRecords file and start interacting with the dataset from within a model. 

The data set it uses is `Cats vs Dogs` and is quite large, ~850Mbs split between test and train sets. So I haven't included it in my repository. However if you are interested in the tutorial it can be found [here][tutorial] and the dataset can be found [here][data].
