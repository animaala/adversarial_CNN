## This is an official TensorFlow tutorial from the tutorials section of the TF website located [here][tf_tutorial]:

The Cifar-10 image set is used, which is a set of RGB 32x32 pixel images with 10 classes. Google for more info on the dataset.

The model is split into multiple `.py` files. Run `python cifar10_train` to run the model (takes hours to train! but good example of how to handle RGB images and bring them into the model etc).
